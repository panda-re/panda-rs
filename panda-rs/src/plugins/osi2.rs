#[doc(inline)]
/// A macro for declaring global kernel data structures accessible via OSI2. The
/// type of which must implement/derive [`OsiType`], which is pulled from the currently
/// loaded Volatility Profile.
///
/// The static provides one main method: `read`, which takes an [`&mut CPUState`](CPUState)
/// and returns a `Result<T, GuestReadFail>`, where `T` is the type of the static.
///
/// Also provided for structs which derive [`OsiType`] is an accessor method for each
/// field.
///
/// For more information, see the [`OsiType`] derive macro.
///
/// ## Attributes
///
/// * `symbol` (required) - specify the symbol within the volatility profile that describes
/// the storage location of the given type. Takes the form of `#[symbol = "..."]`.
/// * `per_cpu` (optional) - specify that the given symbol is a CPU-local kernel structure and
/// should be handled accordingly
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```
/// use panda::plugins::osi2::{OsiType, osi_static};
///
/// #[derive(OsiType, Debug)]
/// #[osi(type_name = "task_struct")]
/// struct TaskStruct {
///     comm: [u8; 0x10],
/// }
///
/// osi_static! {
///     #[per_cpu]
///     #[symbol = "current_task"]
///     static CURRENT_TASK: TaskStruct;
/// }
///
/// # let cpu = unsafe { &mut *panda::sys::get_cpu() };
/// // Read the entire structure
/// let current_task = CURRENT_TASK.read(cpu).unwrap();
///
/// // Read a single field `comm`
/// let process_name = CURRENT_TASK.comm(cpu).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// [`OsiType`]: macro@OsiType
pub use panda_macros::osi_static;

/// A derive macro for allowing a given structure to be used as a type for OS introspection.
///
/// The recommended usage is to declare instances of these types using the [`osi_static`]
/// macro, however [`OsiType::osi_read`] is also available for when an OS data structure
/// is not global.
///
/// ## Attributes
///
/// |     Name    | Field/Struct Level | Required | Description |
/// |:-----------:|:------------------:|:--------:|:------------|
/// | `type_name` |    Struct-Level    |    ✔️     | Sets the name of the type to pull info from within the volatility profile |
/// |   `rename`  |    Field-Level     |          | By default the name of the field within the volatility profile will be assumed to be identical to the field within the Rust type, the `rename` attribute allows overriding this to have the volatility name and Rust field name be separate.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(OsiType, Debug)]
/// #[osi(type_name = "task_struct")]
/// struct TaskStruct {
///     #[osi(rename = "comm")]
///     process_name: [u8; 0x10],
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## How it works
///
/// OSI 2 is based around a system of using volatility 3 profiles (also known as "Symbol Tables")
/// in order to have a semantic understanding of operating system types, in order to leverage
/// the infrastructure of memory forensics to enable high-quality runtime analysis.
///
/// To work with these profiles directly would require parsing them, extracting the
/// offsets/sizes/etc of the data types of interest to the user, and then manually
/// performing address/offset calculations before reading kernel memory and then parsing
/// the resulting bytes. This results in a lot of boilerplate, poor ergonomics, and hard
/// to read and maintain code.
///
/// The goal of this derive macro is to handle address calculation of both global and
/// per-CPU symbols as well as handle pulling symbols from the Volatility Profile and
/// even handling the parsing of bytes from memory.
///
/// The `OsiType` derive macro generates two things:
///
/// 1. It generates an implementation of the [`OsiType`](trait@OsiType) trait for your
/// given type. This specifies how to read the entirety of the type from memory.
///
/// 2. It generates a "method delegator" type. This type has one function: hold onto
/// the symbol of an instance of the structure as well as whether or not the given
/// symbol is per-CPU (such as the current process) or OS-global (such as the syscall
/// table). It then provides a set of methods, one for each field of the type `OsiType` is
/// being derived for. This allows for reading individual fields of a structure without
/// parsing the entire type out of memory.
///
/// To create an instance of the method delegator type, the following can be done:
///
/// ```
/// let symbol = "current_task";
/// let is_per_cpu = true;
///
/// let delegate = <T as OsiType>::MethodDelegator::new(symbol, is_per_cpu);
/// ```
///
/// This is what allows for the [`osi_static`] macro to be used in order to read individual
/// fields of a given type.
