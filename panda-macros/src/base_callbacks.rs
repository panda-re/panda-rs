       Notes:
        `buf_addr_rec` corresponds to the address of the device buffer of
        the emulated NIC. I.e. it is the address of a VM-host-side buffer.
        It is useful for implementing network tainting in an OS-agnostic
        way, in conjunction with taint2_label_io().

        FIXME: The `buf_addr_rec` maps to the `uint8_t *buf` field of the
        internal `RR_handle_packet_args` struct. The field is dumped/loaded
        to/from the trace without proper serialization/deserialization. As
        a result, a 64bit build of PANDA will not be able to process traces
        produced by a 32bit of PANDA, and vice-versa.
        There are more internal structs that suffer from the same issue.
        This is an oversight that will eventually be fixed. But as the
        real impact is minimal (virtually nobody uses 32bit builds),
        the fix has a very low priority in the bugfix list.
